                        <strong>5 May 2013.</strong> First Anniversary<br> Happy Cinco de Mayo! Today is my one year anniversary (with my wife). We celebrated by going to

                        is paper and the modern gift is clocks, so I got Katharina a book where you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Make-Your-Working-Paper-Clock/dp/0060910666">make a clock out of paper</a>. She made me a pillow in modeled after a ticket
                        from the movie theater where we went on our first date and got engaged.

                        that, so now we are engaged. The day before, I ran this diamond ring run (diamond not to scale). Thanks to our family and friends for celebrating with us and for all your congratulations. Most of all, I thank <a href="http://www.thehutt.de/tolkien/fonts.html">Pete Klassen</a>                        for the Ringbearer font used in the legend.

He is moving to Montana and I will miss him. <br> Fun fact #1: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_sign#The_peace_sign">The peace sign</a>                        derives its shape from a combination of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_semaphore">semaphore</a> signals for N and D, signifying nuclear disarmament. True story. That's why I don't feel so bad that I had to cheat
                        and composite two different runs to get it to come out right.<br> Fun fact #2: John F. Kennedy announced the <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/">Peace Corps</a> at the Michigan Union (visible on map) on October 14, 1960.

                        <strong>17 November 2009.</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonids">Leonids.</a> This morning I ran to the wave field to watch the Leonids meteor shower. I saw 5 meteors! It was very exciting. That's 5 more than I
                        saw that sad, overcast morning when I tried to watch the Orionids. I took a pentagram detour in Mitchell field and the parking lot across the street, in honor of our fallen stars.

                        I think this is my most successful run yet. Although I do feel like I cheated because I was running through a giant field, so I wasn't constrained to sidewalks.

                        <strong>13 November 2009.</strong> A tribute to <a href="http://www.weezer.com/">Weezer</a>. There was some construction in the way and the GPS signal was weak, but you can still almost make out what it's supposed to look like.
                        I added a legend for clarity. So this goes out to my favorite band as a tribute. I also have a lightning bolt guitar strap.

                        <strong>11 November 2009.</strong> An attempt at the Michigan block M. My M route is concentric with the block M on diag. GPS data isn't great on campus so the whole right side is bulbous. I had to double back in the south west
                        corner because I thought the sidewalk went through to the diag, but it turns out there's a fence in the way

                        <strong>10 November 2009.</strong> I tried to run a spiral in Palmer field behind MoJo. It didn't work very well. It's hard to tell hard close to the middle you should run each loop when it's dark and you have no reference points.
