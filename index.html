              <strong>5 May 2013.</strong> First Anniversary<br>
              Happy Cinco de Mayo! Today is my one year anniversary (with my wife). We celebrated by going to
              <a href="http://pettingfarm.com/">Domino's Petting Farm</a>, <a href="http://www.putterz.com/">Putterz Golf &amp; Games</a>,
              and <a href="http://www.bluenilemi.com/">Blue Nile</a>. The traditional gift for a first wedding anniversary is paper and
              the modern gift is clocks, so I got Katharina a book where you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Make-Your-Working-Paper-Clock/dp/0060910666">make a clock out of paper</a>. She made me a pillow in modeled after a ticket from the movie theater
              where we went on our first date and got engaged.

              <strong>28 Jan 2011.</strong> Pre pre engaged<br>
              On Jan 28, I asked <a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/katley/home">Katharina Ley</a> if she was
              interested in getting married, and she indicated that she was interested in doing that, so
              now we are engaged. The day before, I ran this diamond ring run (diamond not to scale).
              Thanks to our family and friends for celebrating with us and for all
              your congratulations. Most of all, I thank <a href="http://www.thehutt.de/tolkien/fonts.html">Pete Klassen</a>
              for the Ringbearer font used in the legend. It really made the Lord of the Rings reference land.

              Mmmm, college football. My complete lack of football education allows me project a very successful

							<strong>31 May 2010.</strong> Happy Memorial Day!<br>
							Today we thank the servicepeople who have put our nation's interest before their lives.
							The holiday began as Decoration Day in 1868. Michigan was the first state to make the
							day a state holiday in 1871.<br>
							<br>
							Any likeness between the top left part of the flag and the batman symbol is unintentional
							and should be ignored. I was trying to just make it look like one big star.
							Also, including the run from and to my house, this is the farthest
							I've ever run at one time.

							<strong>14 February 2010.</strong> Happy Valentine's Day!

							<strong>5 February 2010.</strong> My friend Chris asked me to do a peace sign because he's a pretty big
							hippie. He is moving to Montana and I will miss him. <br>
							Fun fact #1: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_sign#The_peace_sign">The peace sign</a> derives
							its shape from a combination of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_semaphore">semaphore</a>
							signals for N and D, signifying nuclear disarmament. True story. That's why I don't feel so bad that I had
							to cheat and composite two different runs to get it to come out right.<br>
							Fun fact #2: John F. Kennedy announced the <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/">Peace Corps</a> at the Michigan Union
							(visible on map) on October 14, 1960.

							<strong>2 January 2010.</strong> I went on a cruise over vacation. I ran on the treadmill one time,
							and I didn't record the GPS, but if I had, it would have looked something like this. At an estimated
							20 mph, the	boat covered around 3 miles in the 9 minutes it took me to run a mile on the treadmill.

							<strong>17 November 2009.</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonids">Leonids.</a> This
							morning I ran to the wave field to watch the Leonids meteor shower. I saw 5 meteors! It was very

							I took a pentagram detour in Mitchell field and the parking lot across the street, in honor of our
							fallen stars.
						</p>
						<p>
							I think this is my most successful run yet. Although I do feel like I cheated because I was running
							through a giant field, so I wasn't constrained to sidewalks.

							<strong>13 November 2009.</strong> A tribute to <a href="http://www.weezer.com/">Weezer</a>. There was

							<strong>11 November 2009.</strong> An attempt at the Michigan block M. My M route is concentric
							with the block M on diag. GPS data isn't great on campus so the whole right side is bulbous. I

							diag, but it turns out there's a fence in the way

							<strong>10 November 2009.</strong> I tried to run a spiral in Palmer field behind MoJo. It didn't work very well.
